## What is the Insinger Monitoring & Evaluation Tool?

This tool allows you to easily generate reports on the basis of projects that have been co-funded by the Insinger Foundation. After logging in, acces is granted to project information and progress can be reported. These reports allow the Insinger Foundation to monitor the effectiveness of contributions more effectively. The project is split into a front and back-end repository for sake of clear development.
